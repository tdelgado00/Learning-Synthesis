This repository contains the implemantation of a Reinforcement Learning approach for the Directed Controller Synthesis problem.

RL agents are heuristics for the On-the-fly DCS algorithm implemented at [MTSA](https://mtsa.dc.uba.ar/).

This is a work in progress at [Lafhis](https://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/), University of Buenos Aires.

Usage instructions coming soon.
